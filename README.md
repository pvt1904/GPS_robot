# GPS Robot Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the GPS-based robot project.  

## Required Libraries  
Before compiling the project, make sure to install the following libraries:  

- **QMC5883LCompass** (`QMC5883LCompass-master.zip`)  
- **TinyGPSPlus** (`TinyGPSPlus-master.zip`)  

You need to download and add these libraries to your Arduino IDE or your projectâ€™s `libraries` folder.  

More updates will be added as the project progresses.
